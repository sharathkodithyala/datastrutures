//0.1Two moving pointers, regardless of directions, moving dependently or independently;
//2.A function that utilizes the entries referenced by the two pointers, which relates to the answer in a way;
//3.An easy way of deciding which pointer to move;
//4.A way to process the array when the pointers are moved.
