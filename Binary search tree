Binary Search Tree (BST)
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that maintains a specific order property. For each node in the tree:

All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.
All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.
This property makes BSTs particularly useful for searching, insertion, and deletion operations, which can all be performed efficiently.

Key Characteristics:
Nodes:
Each node contains a value, and references to its left and right children.
Root:
The top node of the BST.
Leaves:
Nodes that do not have any children.
Subtrees:
The left and right subtrees of a node must themselves be binary search trees.
